    "Good news: the number of rows containing NaNs seems to be quite limited counting both per year and by city. Moreover, the fraction of those rows that *only* contain NaNs - and therefore look unsalvageable - is usually quite low, although there are exceptions (e.g. Atlanta, New Orleans). It should be noted, however, that missing values only appear between 1991 and 2012, so that their influence is somewhat bigger than if they were homogeneously spread across the whole DataFrame.\n",

    "* a good number of them just has a single NaN, which can then be inferred so that the total number of deaths is achieved;\n",
    "* some other rows lack more than one value, but the numbers of deaths per age group that appear already sum up to the total number of deaths, hence the NaN's can be replaced with 0s;\n",
    "* some other rows have multiple NaN's, which cannot be unambiguously determined: one strategy would be to replace all of them but one with the mean value in that city over the last n months/years and the final with what's required to achieve the total number of deaths (do this on the rightmost NaN, as it's likely to have a higher number of deaths among older sectors of the population and this can better accomodate a fluctuation that might otherwise look weird in the first columns -- if in a particular week, say, 5 toddlers died, when the average number is 0.8);\n",
    "* finally there are rows with all NaN's, which are useless and can be discarded: from the looks of it I won't be losing more than a few data points (out of 52) per year, which sounds reasonable."
