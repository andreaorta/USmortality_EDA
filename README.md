# Project: US mortality 1962-2016

This is a primitive draft of a ReadMe to explain the purpose of this project.

In a few words, I'm practicing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a database reporting the number of deaths across 122 cities in the US, over the course of several decades (1962-2016).

The analysis is based on a .csv database, downloadable from [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/deaths-in-122-u-s-cities-1962-2016-122-cities-mortality-reporting-system).

More to come...
